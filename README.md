# MUJI Website Redesign Concept

This project presents a modern redesign concept for the MUJI (無印良品) e-commerce experience. It reimagines the brand's signature minimalist aesthetic with enhanced interactivity, a refined product browsing flow, and a streamlined checkout process, all built with vanilla web technologies.

## Concept & Vision

This redesign aims to elevate the online shopping experience for MUJI's audience by focusing on:

*   **Enhanced Clarity:** Streamlining information architecture to make product discovery and purchase decisions effortless.
*   **Refined Interactions:** Implementing subtle animations and transitions to create a more engaging and premium feel.
*   **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** Ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience across all device sizes, prioritizing touch interactions.
*   **Functional Minimalism:** Keeping the design clean and uncluttered while ensuring all necessary e-commerce functionalities (cart, checkout, product details) are robust and user-friendly.

## Key Improvements

Compared to a typical e-commerce site, this redesign concept introduces:

*   **Dynamic Product Filtering:** Intuitive category filtering on the products page.
*   **Detailed Product Views:** Dedicated pages with clear descriptions, features, and specifications.
*   **Persistent Shopping Cart:** Uses `localStorage` to remember items between visits.
*   **Interactive UI Elements:** Includes mobile navigation, quantity selectors, and visual feedback.
*   **Streamlined Checkout:** A clear, multi-step process (simulated) focused on essential information.
